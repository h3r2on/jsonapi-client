# DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used.
# Project now uses pyproject.toml with UV for package management.
#
# For development, use:
#   uv sync --all-extras
#
# Or with pip:
#   pip install -e ".[test,dev,docs]"
#
# The dependencies are now defined in pyproject.toml under [project.dependencies]
# and [project.optional-dependencies]
